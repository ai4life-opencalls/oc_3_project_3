# Project #3: Improving nuclei segmentation using Cellprofiler and StarDist
---

**Martin Neuenschwander** (Forschungsinstitut für Molekulare Pharmakologie, Berlin, Germany) and his team are systematically treating HepG2 cells (a cell line of human liver cancer) with hundreds to thousands of small-molecule compounds.  They use the Cell Painting assay, a high‑content fluorescence microscopy method, to image different cellular structures (nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, cytoskeleton, and more) with multiplexed dyes to understand which of them are affected by the compound. The automated image acquisition and computational feature extraction generate rich, quantitative fingerprints of each compound’s effect on cell morphology and subcellular organization.

The objective is to create an open database of the compounds with their phenotipic profile, also publishing the acquired images in the Bioimage Archive. This comprehensive dataset has the potential to help researchers worldwide to cluster compounds by mode of action, predict biological targets, and discover novel drug leads.

To perform the image analysis
